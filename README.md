# Dynamic Travel Itinerary Planner

# Overview

Planning a trip involves juggling multiple factors like budget, personal interests, real-time conditions, and local events, making it overwhelming for travelers. Most itinerary planners rely on static recommendations and fail to adapt to spontaneous changes, such as unexpected weather, local closures, or shifting personal preferences.

Our Dynamic Travel Itinerary Planner aims to revolutionize travel planning by providing a context-aware, real-time adaptable itinerary generator. Unlike traditional platforms that offer generic travel suggestions, our solution considers real-world factors such as:

Weather conditions

Time constraints

Crowd levels

Transportation availability

Local events

By dynamically adjusting plans based on user mood, preferences, and real-time conditions, this application offers a smarter, more personalized travel experience.
